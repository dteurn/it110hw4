<p>The image of the corgi is A.I generated from Stable Diffusion. He is based off of my service dog, Boji.
    I do not know how to make a link to Stable Diffusion yet. Also, I couldn't find my original image from HW1,
    so I used the above image instead. The theme is a corgi riding a crimson red fire breathing dragon. However,
    instead of a dragon, the image shows an airplane.The purpose of this image is to complete homework 4 but to
    also practice CSS. Anyway, thanks for visiting my page!</p>
<p>The A.I tool i used was Stable Diffusion. The prompt I used was Pembroke Welsh Corgi riding on top of a crimson
    red fire breathing dragon flying over an army of space traveling otters. As you cna see, there's a creature that
    looks like an otter located at the butt of the airplane to your right. I did not use any model settings. I chose
    this specific prompt because I love my dog and I thought it would be funny to see him riding a dragon flying over
    an army of otters. ALL HAIL KING BOJI!!!!!</p>
